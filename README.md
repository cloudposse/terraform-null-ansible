Terraform Module to run ansible playbooks.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).
>
> <details>
> <summary><strong>Watch demo of using Atmos with Terraform</strong></summary>
> <img src="https://github.com/cloudposse/atmos/blob/master/docs/demo.gif?raw=true"/><br/>
> <i>Example of running <a href="https://atmos.tools"><code>atmos</code></a> to manage infrastructure from our <a href="https://atmos.tools/quick-start/">Quick Start</a> tutorial.</i>
> </detalis>





## Usage

### Add special section to the playbook

You must add this section on the top of all playbooks that will be used for provisioning.

This will add a dynamic inventory to target the host that needs provisioning.

e.g. `../ansible/playbooks/playbook.yml`

* Create a runtime inventorty with an ip address of a host
* Wait for target host is ready for ssh connection

```yaml

---
- hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: True
  check_mode: no
  tasks:
  - name: Add public ip addresses to an dynamic inventory
    add_host:
      name: "{{ host }}"
      groups: all

  - local_action: wait_for port=22 host="{{ host }}" search_regex=OpenSSH delay=10

- hosts: all
  gather_facts: False
  check_mode: no
  become: True
  tasks:
  - name: Install python 2.7
    raw: >
      test -e /usr/bin/python ||
      (
        (test -e /usr/bin/apt-get && (apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y python)) ||
        (test -e /usr/bin/yum && (yum makecache fast && yum install -y python))
      )
    args:
      creates: /usr/bin/python
```

### Create an aws instance

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type = "t1.micro"
  tags {
    Name        = test1
  }
}
```

### Apply the provisioner module to this resource

```hcl
module "ansible_provisioner" {
  source    = "github.com/cloudposse/tf_ansible"

  arguments = ["--user=ubuntu"]
  envs      = ["host=${aws_instance.web.public_ip}"]
  playbook  = "../ansible/playbooks/test.yml"
  dry_run   = false

}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
